\section{Proof of reduction of theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{mainthm}]
    By Proposition \ref{Tracebound},
\[    |W|\ll N^2 V^{-2} + N V^{-2} S^{1/3}.\]
Recall we have $S\defeq S_2+S_3$, where 
\[
    S_2 \lesssim_k N^2|W|^2 + qTN|W|^{2-1/k} + N^2|W|^2 \Big(\frac{(qT)^{1/2}}{|W|^{3/4}}\Big)^{1/k}.
\]
    by Proposition \ref{s2bound}, and
    \[
        S_3\lesssim (qT)^2|W|^{3/2} + N(qT)|W|^{1/2}E(W)^{1/2} 
    \]
    by Proposition \ref{s3refined}.
    Finally, by Proposition \ref{energybound}, we have
    \begin{align*}
E(W)\lesssim |W|N^{4-4\sigma}+|W|^{21/8}(qT)^{1/4}N^{1-2\sigma}+|W|^3N^{1-2\sigma}.
    \end{align*}
    These are analgous statements to Proposition 4.6, Propositions 6.1 (summed with Proposition 5.1), Proposition 10.1, and Proposition 11.1 in \cite{GM2024} respectively with 
    $T$ swapped with $qT$. Thus the reduction is the same as in the proof of Proposition 3.1.
\end{proof}
