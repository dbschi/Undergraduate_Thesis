\section{The Prime Number Theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Prime Number Theorem]
    Let $\Pi(x)=\sum_{p<=n} 1$. Then \[
        \Pi(x) = (1+o(1))\frac{x}{\log x}.
    \]
\end{theorem}

In this section we will prove the Prime Number Theorem.
However, note that this result is a minor goal of this paper.
The Prime Number Theorem provides an illustration of multiple ideas
and techniques of manipulating the zeta function.
Furthermore, this theorem serves as a starting point for
studying primes in short intervals, and demonstrates why the proof of
RH (or the weaker LH) is widely sought after, thus sets the stage for zero-density theorems.
