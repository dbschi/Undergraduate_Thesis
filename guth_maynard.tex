\section{Guth-Maynard's proof of Large Values of Dirichlet Polynomials}
\begin{theorem}[Guth-Maynard Large Values Estimate]
    Let $(b_n)$ be a sequence of complex numbers such that $|b_n|\leq 1$ for all $n$, and $W=\{t_j\}_{j=1}^{|W|}$ be a $1$-separated set $\subseteq [0,T]$, such that \[
    \left|\sum_{n\sim N}b_n n^{it_j}\right|\geq V
    \]
    for each $t_j\in W$. Then \[
    |W|\lesssim N^2V^{-2}+N^{18/5}V^{-4}+TN{12/5}V^{-4}.
    \]
\end{theorem}
Let us compare this bound to Lemma \ref{halasz}, which states \[
|W|\lesssim N^2V^{-2}+N^4V^{-6}.
\]
In the critical case $V=T^{3/4}, N\leq T^{5/6-\epsilon}$, the original bound will give \[
|W|\lesssim N^2T^{-3/2}+N^4T^{-9/2},
\]
while the bound by Guth and Maynard gives \[
|W|\lesssim N^2T^{-3/2}+N^{18/5}T^{-9/2}.
\]
